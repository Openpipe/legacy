== Data Item
The _item_ is the base unit of information managed in a datapipe. Because _items_ are python objects, their types are dynammicaly set and can be any of the python supported data types.

== Pipeline Step
A step is a processing unit that receives and/or produces items. A step receives control instructions and produces events, it may receive and/or produce items. A step is bind to a plugin, steps are most commonly connected to other steps, creating a datapipe path. A single step will have multiple instances when parallell processing is set.

== Pipeline Path
A pipeline path is a sequence/list of steps, it must be defined inside a _label:_ labels can be used to connect different paths. A pipeline MUST contain a _start:_ path. This path is executed when a pipeline is started.

Example:

```yaml
start:
    - step one
    ...
    - pipeline control send_to:
        big_size: [ size>20 ] #
    ...
    - last step:

big_size:
    - insert into big_size database
```
