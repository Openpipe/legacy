Why mdatapipe ?
###############
As a system administrator, business analyst or application developer you may
need to collect, filter, transform and produce reports from data/logs systems/applications
logs/data.

While there maybe many resource/tecnhology specific tools for such tasks, integrating
data from multiple dataources is not an easy task.

mdatapipe is a general purpose data processing engine,
which allows to build data flows «also known as pipelines» between
different components in an efficient manner.
