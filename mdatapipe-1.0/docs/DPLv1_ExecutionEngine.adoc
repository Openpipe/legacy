== Requirements
It is required to have a proper understanding of the  link:DatapipePipelineLanguageV1.adoc[Data Pipeline Language v1] before reading this document.

== Introduction
The DPL execution engine is the software required to run a data pipeline. It reads a DPL document, creates all the required component instances, does the setup of input/output connections between them and starts the pipeline execution.

== Execution Profiles
The DPL does not set any conditions on the localization of the component instance's for a pipeline. An entire pipeline maybe running in a single thread of a single process in a single system, or distributed across multiple threads, processes or systems.

The following properties of execution profiles must be observed:

    - A constant pipeline with a constant input must produce a constant output when running under different execution profiles
    - The order of the outputs items is not guaranteed to be constant between runs nor profiles, unless the pipeline ends with an `order by` step, or the segment _sequential_ property is set to True.kv
    - Execution over different engines may produce different failures (due to profile specific constrains)
    - They may provide very different performances (for the same pipeline/input data)

The execution profiles currently available are:

    - synchronous-single-thread (default)

More details about each profile will be provided in the next sections.

=== synchronous-single-thread

This is the default profile, it requires less resources and provides better performance operating with small data sets. It is however constrained to use a single CPU core.
